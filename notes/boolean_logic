express truth table boolean functions with NAND
express truth table boolean functions with NOR
NAND logic
NOR logic

processors can be created using NAND gates alone

remove duplication
NAND completeness
not A = A NAND A
A and B = not (A NAND B) = (A NAND B) NAND (A NAND B)
A or B = (A NAND A) NAND (B NAND B)

NOR completeness
not A = A NOR A
A and B = (A NOR A) NOR (B NOR B)
A or B = not (A NOR B) = (A NOR B) NOR (A NOR B)

NOT A = A NAND A = A NOR A
A AND B = (A NAND B) NAND (A NAND B) = (A NOR A) NOR (B NOR B)
A OR B = (A NAND A) NAND (B NAND B) = (A NOR B) NOR (A NOR B)
