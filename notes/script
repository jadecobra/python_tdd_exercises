laugh out loud at start, this is fun
how can I make this easier?
how can I make this more fun?
pause between sentences - count 1 mississippi
pause after typing code to show it, give the consumer a chance to catch up

intro
do it with a smile - make it interesting - the intention is the viewer feels warm and welcome
- Welcome to PUMPING PYTHON
- My name is Jacob Itegboje

body
- read the symbols out loud - underscores, parentheses, square brackets, curly braces, quotes - what if the consumer cannot see?
- type out instead of copying and pasting to give the consumer time to digest what is happening, wait after typing code
- slow down, imagine the viewer asked a question
- pause for 1 second after code lines
- pause for 2 seconds at section change - i.e. new test
- remove terminal when you have a passing test to create space for reading

outro
- close terminal
- review tests
- review solution
- say "Thank you for sticking with me to the end. What would you like to do next?" - same energy as the beginning
- count down from 5 to 1

book - I add
video - I will add
always read out the line of code you are typing

record the editing process
emphasize highlighted words
sing
use emotions - anger, laughter, be very expressive - overly so, it is a high cost to create a high value thing
imagine you are

how can I make the reader/viewer feel I am right next to them and we are doing this together and it is fun - come on! you can do it

I know you do not have a lot of time, so I will try to make this quick

record - edit while recording
listen to recording - edit from recording
