Conventions
===========

The following are a few conventions to know in python


* Comments are represented by the hashtag or pound before the thing that is commented for example

  .. code-block::

    # This is a comment

* Enclosures must be closed once open, which means they happen in pairs for example

  .. code-block:: python

    ""
    """"""
    ''
    ''''''
    ()
    []
    {}

* Quotes represent strings and can be single, double, triple single or triple double for example

  .. code-block:: python

    "Text"
    'Text'
    """Multiline Text
    with triple double quotes
    """
    '''Multiline Text
    with triple single quotes
    '''

* A tuple is a sequence or collection of data that cannot be changed later, it is immutable and represented with parentheses/brackets for example

  .. code-block:: python

    (1, 2.5, "three", [4, 'five'])

* A list/array is a sequence of collection of data that can be changed after it is defined, it is mutable and represented with square brackets for example

  .. code-block:: python

    [1, 2.5, 'three', (4, "five")]

* Sets/Dictionaries/Mappings are represented with curly braces/brackets - ``{}``
