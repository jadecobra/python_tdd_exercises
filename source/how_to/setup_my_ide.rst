How I setup my Interactive Development Environment (IDE)
========================================================

As of the writing of this book I use `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>_`

Visual Studio Extensions
------------------------

Here are extensions I use to customize Visual Studio Code

* `Dark Rainbow Theme <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DarkRainbow.darkrainbow>`_ - I like pretty colors
* `indent-rainbow <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow>`_ - I really like pretty colors
* `Pylance <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance>`
* `Python <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python>`_
* `Black Formatter <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter>`_


Screen Layout
-------------
* I split my screen in the following ways depending on the use case

  - When using a reference I have the reference on the left and Visual Studio Code on the right, the reverse also works
  - When working only in Visual Studio Code I have the following windows open depending on what I want to see

    * explorer - when I need to see files/folder structure
    * 2 editors - one for tests, one for source code
    * terminal at the bottom - to show results of the tests, when the results I am looking at in the terminal are too long for the bottom, I move the terminal to the right of the screen
