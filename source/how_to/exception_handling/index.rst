how to handle Exceptions (Errors)
#################################################################################

When an :ref:`error<errors>` happens in Python_, an :ref:`Exception<errors>` is raised to stop the program, this means nothing past the line that caused the :ref:`error<errors>` runs.

It is useful because there is a problem that must be solved for the program_ to continue, and it is a problem when it causes the program_ to stop early.

What if I want the program_ to run even with errors? I might want to give messages to the user who does not care about or understand the details of the error.

:ref:`Exception<errors>` Handling is a way to deal with this, it allows programs to do something different when an :ref:`error<errors>` happens.

These tests show how to handle :ref:`Errors(Exceptions)<errors>` in :ref:`tests<how to test that an Exception is raised>` and in :ref:`programs<how to handle Exceptions (Errors) in programs>`
