how to handle Exceptions
#################################################################################

When an :ref:`error<errors>` happens in Python_, an :ref:`Exception<errors>` is raised to break execution of the program, this means nothing past the line that caused it will run.

It is useful because there is a problem to be solved to continue as expected, and it can be a pain when it causes the program to stop early.

What if I want it to run even with errors? I might want to give messages to the user who does not care about or understand the details of the error.

:ref:`Exception<errors>` Handling is a way to deal with this, it allows programs to make decisions when an :ref:`error<errors>` happens.

The following tests cover how to handle :ref:`Errors(Exceptions)<errors>` in :ref:`tests<how to test that an Exception is raised>` and in :ref:`programs<how to handle Exceptions in programs>`
