How I setup my Interactive Development Environment (IDE)
##########################################################

***************************
Screen Layout
***************************

I split my screen in the following ways depending on the use case

- When using a reference I like to have it on the left and the Interactive Development Environment on the right. What works for you?

  .. image:: images/reference_on_left.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Reference on the left

- When working only in the Interactive Development Environment I have the following windows open depending on what I want to see

  * explorer - to see files/folder structure
  * editors side by side - one for tests, one for source code

    .. image:: images/2_editors.png
      :width: 400
      :alt: editors side by side

  * the terminal to show results of the tests

    - at the bottom - for most cases

      .. image:: images/terminal_on_bottom.png
        :width: 400
        :alt: Terminal Window at the bottom

    - to the right - when the results I am looking at in the terminal are too long to see at once, I move it to the right of the screen

      .. image:: images/terminal_on_right.png
        :width: 400
        :alt: Terminal Window on the right

This setup allows me to make comparisons by asking myself

* What is similar?
* What is different?

Visual Studio Extensions
***************************

As of the writing of this book I use `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>`_. Here are extensions I use to customize it.

* `Dark Rainbow Theme <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DarkRainbow.darkrainbow>`_ - I like pretty colors
* `indent-rainbow <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow>`_ - did I mention I love for pretty colors?
* `Python <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python>`_ - python helper
* `Black Formatter <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter>`_ - code formatter
