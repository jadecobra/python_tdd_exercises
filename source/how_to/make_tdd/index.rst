how to make a test driven development environment
#################################################################################

I set up an environment for every Python_ project, this way I keep all the things that belong to the project in the same place. I can do this manually, which means I have to do the same exact steps for every project or I could do it automatically where I give the computer a command and it does all those steps for me.

These chapters show how I setup a project in Python_ on any computer (Linux_, Windows_, MacOS_)to help you get started with `Test Driven Development`_ right now
