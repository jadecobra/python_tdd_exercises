What follows is an exercise in measuring learning. It is somewhat philosophical in its meaning but arithmetic in its representation. I am curious to know what you think and what solutions you come up with

An Infinite Learning Model
********************************************************

red: make it fail

add a file called ``test_learning_models.py`` to the ``tests`` folder with the following contents

.. literalinclude:: /code/tests/test_learning_models.py


green: make it pass

If you've gone through any of the other exercises in this book, then you have what you need to solve these problems

Please send me your solutions. I would love to see them
