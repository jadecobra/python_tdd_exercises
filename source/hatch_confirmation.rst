Congratulations! You have successfully joined a Pumping Python HATCH! I look forward to the next 8 weeks with you.

*********************************************************************************
what should I expect?
*********************************************************************************

* Every Monday to Friday we get together for 2 hours to read, write and test Python_
* At the end of the 8 weeks you will have written over 100 tests
* In our time together I will answer any questions you have about what you are learning
* We will share screens so I can see mistakes and help you where needed
* At the end of every class I will give you a chapter from the book to go over before our next class. If you do it before the class, our time together will be a review. If you do not, our time together will be you going through the chapter
* There will be quizzes and presentations to test your skills
* There will be confusion and headaches as you go through the process, which means you will feel like you do not know what you are doing a lot of the time, it is part of the learning process and
* We will have a lot of fun
* You can also send me a message anytime and I will respond once I get it, and if we need to get on a call to resolve some problem, we will do that

*********************************************************************************
what is next?
*********************************************************************************

* **Check Your Email:** You should see a recurring invitation for the next 8 weeks. Please accept it now. If you do not see it, check your spam folder since this is probably the first time I have sent you an email.
* **WhatsApp Community:** I will add you to a WhatsApp group for the class where we can text and share links about the class.
* **Setup your Integrated Development Environment:** :ref:`Click Here for how to set up your computer the way I have mine setup, before our first session<how I setup my Integrated Development Environment (IDE)>`

.. note::

  Our sessions start right at the time. Please log in 5 minutes early to test your audio/video setup. If you are a last minute person like me, the WhatsApp group will have a link in the description to the video call for the class (It's always the same link for the 8 weeks)
