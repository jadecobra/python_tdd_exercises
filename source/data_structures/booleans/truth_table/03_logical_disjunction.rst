This chapter continues the adventure with conditional statements for Logical Disjunction from the `Truth Table <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table>`_

Reviewing the tests I have so far, I know that

* I can express ``conditional statements`` on one line with ``return``
* when there are multiple outcomes I only need to write the condition for the special case and use ``else`` for the others
* ``logical conjunction`` is and_
* :ref:`False<test_what_is_false>` is not_ :ref:`True<test_what_is_true>`
* :ref:`True<test_what_is_true>` is not_ :ref:`False<test_what_is_false>`
* :ref:`False<test_what_is_false>` is :ref:`False<test_what_is_false>`
* :ref:`True<test_what_is_true>` is :ref:`True<test_what_is_true>`




The tests so far show that for any boolean operation involving 2 inputs: ``p`` and ``q`` which can take the values :ref:`True<test_what_is_true>` or :ref:`False<test_what_is_false>`


* ``logical disjunction`` is or_
* and_ is "not or_"
* or_ is "not and_"
* ``logical conjunction`` is and_
* :ref:`False<test_what_is_false>` is not_ :ref:`True<test_what_is_true>`
* :ref:`True<test_what_is_true>` is not_ :ref:`False<test_what_is_false>`
* :ref:`False<test_what_is_false>` is :ref:`False<test_what_is_false>`
* :ref:`True<test_what_is_true>` is :ref:`True<test_what_is_true>`
