Welcome to `Pumping Python`_, My name is Jacob Itegboje and these are `Test Driven Development`_ exercises that helped me use the Python_ programming language for more than a decade. I have tried different ways of learning from books, courses, videos and exercises to working on personal projects and I find that the most effective way to learn is to build something. Of all the things I tried, the thing that helped me build and learn most effectively was `Test Driven Development`_

This is a way to write software with a focus on tests. I write tests for ideas to reach a goal or meet a requirement, and the results tell me if I am closer to the goal or not. I repeat the process until I get to the goal. It feels like the scientific method to me.

I also find that sometimes when I am working on a project and have an idea, I remember I have a test for that idea in another project and can go back to run it or write a new test.

I recommend `Test Driven Development by Example`_ by `Kent Beck`_ and Refactoring_ by `Martin Fowler`_, they both influenced the way I write programs_.

*********************************************************************************
who is this for?
*********************************************************************************

* If you are interested in Python_, this is for you
* If you just started your journey, CONGRATULATIONS! You picked Python_ from the list of `Programming Languages`_ out there, Celebrate it, this is for you
* If you are new to `Test Driven Development`_ in Python_, this is for you
* If you have been telling yourself, "I will learn Python_ some day", today is the day, this is for you
* If you already use Python_ but do not know any of the :ref:`Exceptions<errors>` below, this is for you

  - :ref:`AssertionError`
  - :ref:`AttributeError`
  - :ref:`IndexError<test_index_error>`
  - :ref:`KeyError<test_key_error>`
  - :ref:`ModuleNotFoundError`
  - :ref:`NameError<test_catching_name_error_in_tests>`
  - :ref:`TypeError`
  - ValueError_

*********************************************************************************
how can I use this?
*********************************************************************************

Start with :ref:`how to make a python test driven development environment <how to make a python test driven development environment>` because it is required by every other chapter, each chapter suggests the next chapter to do, or you can choose how you go through the chapters based on what you like. You can also go through the :ref:`how tos` section step by step, the other chapters cover :ref:`errors`, :ref:`data structures`, :ref:`functions`, and :ref:`classes`

Here are a few things I would do if I were in your shoes to make the process more fun

* type out the code portions of a chapter without copying and pasting - this increases your typing speed and helps you see the difference between two things faster

  .. TIP:: You can take a typing test at https://www.keybr.com/typing-test before and after you go through the book to see how it affects your typing speed

* at the end of a chapter, delete the tests and try to write them from memory or use the solution as a guide - this builds your memory skills
* close the tests at the end of a chapter, delete the solution and try to write one with the terminal_ response as a guide - this helps you build a better relationship with the terminal_ (your best friend when programming)
* try to write solutions using the tests from the :ref:`catalog_of_tests` as a guide
* try adding tests for any ideas I get as I go through a chapter, the sooner you start writing tests the better, since it requires a different way of thinking
* I would not quit until I get to the end of a chapter, especially when it gets hard, this is part of the experience when learning to solve problems, things get harder before they get easy because there is a lot of failure. I can always walk away to go do something different for a while, then come back and try again. If you take one small step at a time you eventually get where you want to go
