Welcome to pumping python
==========================
This book is a collection of exercises to get you writing python code immediately using Test Driven Development.

It is a culmination of what has worked for me over the past 10 years learning the language and observing other people use it.

If you are just starting your journey, congratulations! You made a decision from the many choices of programming languages available. Celebrate it.

If you are new to Test Driven Development in python this book is also for you.

How to use this book
--------------------

You can choose how you go through the chapters by starting with any one you like or one that looks like it could solve your current problem.

Here is how I recommend you use the book

* start with  :doc:`How to Setup a Test Driven Development Environment <setup_tdd_environment>` because it is required by every other chapter
* type out the code portions as you go through each chapter - do not copy and paste
* repeat a chapter you like until you can do it from memory
* try recreating the tests from memory or write new tests for a concept you are learning
* in chapters like the ``How tos`` try writing the solutions from the tests only
