Welcome to pumping python
==========================
This book is a collection of exercises to get you writing python code immediately using Test Driven Development.

It is a culmination of what has worked for me over the past 10 years learning the language and observing other people use it.

Who is this book for?
---------------------
* If you are just starting your journey, congratulations! You made a decision from the many choices of programming languages available. Celebrate it. This book is for you
* If you are new to Test Driven Development in python, this book is for you
* If you already use python but are unfamiliar with any of the errors below, this book is for you

  - :doc:`ModuleNotFoundError`
  - :doc:`AssertionError`
  - :doc:`AttributeError`
  - :doc:`TypeError`

It will show you how to trigger errors and resolve them, there are also a few drills that will get you used to certain concepts

How to use this book
--------------------

You can choose how you go through the chapters by starting with any you like or that looks like it could solve your current problem.

Here is how I recommend you use the book

* start with  :doc:`How to Setup a Test Driven Development Environment <setup_tdd_environment>` because it is required by every other chapter
* type out the code portions as you go through each chapter - do not copy and paste
* repeat a chapter you like until you can do it from memory
* try recreating the tests from memory or write new tests for a concept you are learning
* try writing the solutions for the tests in chapters like the ``HOW TOs``
* try adding tests for any ideas you get as you go through a chapter
