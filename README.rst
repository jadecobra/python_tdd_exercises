My name is Jacob Itegboje and this is a collection of `Test Driven Development`_ exercises that have helped me use Python for more than a decade.
`Test Driven Development`_ is a way to write software with a focus on tests. I write tests for ideas to reach a goal or meet a requirement, and the results tell me if I am closer to the goal or not. I repeat the process until I get to the goal.

I recommend reading `Kent Beck’s <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck>`_ `Test Driven Development by Example`_ and `Martin Fowler’s <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler_(software_engineer)>`_ `Refactoring`_, they both influenced the way I write programs.

who is this for?
*********************************************************************************

* If you are interested in Python, this is for you
* If you just started your journey, CONGRATULATIONS! You picked Python from the many `programming languages <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language>`_ out there, Celebrate it, this is for you
* If you are new to `Test Driven Development`_ in Python, this is for you
* If you already use Python but do not know any of the Exceptions_ below, this is for you

  - :ref:`AssertionError`
  - :ref:`AttributeError`
  - :ref:`IndexError<test_index_error>`
  - :ref:`KeyError <test_key_error>`
  - :ref:`ModuleNotFoundError`
  - NameError_
  - :ref:`TypeError`
  - ValueError_

*********************************************************************************
how can I use this?
*********************************************************************************

Start with :ref:`how to make a python test driven development environment <how to make a python test driven development environment>` because it is needed by the other chapters,  then choose how you go through the chapters based on what you like, or you could go through the :ref:`how-tos` section step by step, the other chapters cover :ref:`errors`, :ref:`data structures`, :ref:`functions`, and :ref:`classes`

Here are a few things I would do if I were in your shoes to make the process more fun

* type out the code portions of a chapter without copying and pasting
* at the end of a chapter, delete the tests and try to write them from memory or use the solution as a guide
* close the tests at the end of a chapter, delete the solution and try to write one with the terminal response as a guide
* try to write solutions using the tests from the :ref:`catalog_of_tests` as a guide
* try adding tests for any ideas I get as I go through a chapter, the sooner you start writing tests the better since it requires a different way of thinking
* I would not quit until I get to the end of a chapter, especially when it is hard, this is part of the experience when learning to solve problems, things get harder before they are easier because there is a lot of failure. I can always walk away to go do something different for a while, then come back and try again. If you take one small step at a time you eventually get where you want to go

There are videos for every chapter, check them out here `<https://www.youtube.com/@JacobItegboje>`_
