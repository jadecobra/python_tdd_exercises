# How to write conditions in python

We will continue to step through learning conditional statements in python using Test Driven Development using the [Truth Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table)

Reviewing what we know so far, for any boolean operation involving 2 inputs - `p` and `q` which can take the values `True` or `False`
- `and` is "not `or`"
- `or` is "not `and`"
- `logical_disjunction` is `or`
- `logical_conjunction` is `and`
- `False` is `not True`
- `True` is `not False`
- `False` is `False`
- `True` is `True`
- `return True if x else y` can be rewritten as `return x` if `x` evaluates to `True`
- when there are multiple outcomes we only need to write the condition for the special case and use `else` for the others

## Prerequisites

- [Setup a Test Driven Development Environment](./TDD_SETUP.md)

## Logical Implication/Material Implication

### <span style="color:red">**RED**</span>: make it fail

add a test for logical implication to `TestBinaryOperations`

```python
    def test_logical_implication_aka_material_implication(self):
        self.assertTrue(truth_table.logical_implication(True, True))
        self.assertFalse(truth_table.logical_implication(True, False))
        self.assertTrue(truth_table.logical_implication(False, True))
        self.assertTrue(truth_table.logical_implication(False, False))
```

the terminal updates to show an [AttributeError](./01_ATTRIBUTE_ERROR.md)

### <span style="color:green">**GREEN**</span>: make it pass

- add a function definition with `True` as the return value since that is what is expected in 3 out of the 4 cases
    ```python
    def logical_implication(p, q):
        return True
    ```
    the terminal updates to show the second case failing
- add a condition for this case
    ```python
    def logical_implication(p, q):
        if p == True:
            if q == False:
                return False
        return True
    ```
    the tests pass!

### <span style="color:orange">**REFACTOR**</span>: make it better

- How can we make this better? let's make the nested condition one line
    ```python
    def logical_implication(p, q):
        if p == True and q == False:
            return False
        return True
    ```
    the tests still pass
- in the earlier examples we replaced the equality tests with implied condition statements
    ```python
    def logical_implication(p, q):
        if p and not q:
            return False
        return True
    ```
    this looks simpler and the tests still pass.
- let's write out the second half with an `else` statement to be explicit
    ```python
    def logical_implication(p, q):
        if p and not q:
            return False
        else:
            return True
    ```
- if we replace the `else` with the opposite of the `if` statement we get
    ```python
    def logical_implication(p, q):
        if p and not q:
            return False
        if not(p and not q):
            return True
    ```
- "multiplying" it out
    ```python
    def logical_implication(p, q):
        if p and not q:
            return False
        if not p not and not not q:
            return True
    ```
    We get a `SyntaxError` and correct the syntax to get
    ```python
    def logical_implication(p, q):
        if p and not q:
            return False
        if not p or q:
            return True
        ```
- We reorder
    ```python
    def logical_implication(p, q):
        if not p or q:
            return True
        if p and not q:
            return False
    ```
- replace the second statement with an `else`
    ```python
    def logical_implication(p, q):
        if not p or q:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    ```
- try to write it as one line?
    ```python
    def logical_implication(p, q):
        return True if not p or q else False
    ```
- we simplify using python's implicit conditional testing
    ```python
    def logical_implication(p, q):
        return not p or q
    ```
    fantastic! the tests pass
